# PythonScripts
A miscellaneous collection of Python 2.7 and Python 3 scripts

## TestCodes.py
This is just a collection of functions that I've worked on. They don't rely on any other function in the module. Most of these are simple functions that helped me learn the language, or helped me understand how to teach the material better. A couple functions are my solutions to puzzles I found on codewars.com

## P2P2 Grading Scripts
These scripts are designed to grade the second project for the Spring 2020 semester at NC State. They are designed to face nearly any scenario, and they are color-coded and are easy to read.
